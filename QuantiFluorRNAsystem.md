## Prepare the solutions
- [ ] Thaw the QuantiFluor® RNA Dye at room temperature in a drawer to protect it from light. Thaw the RNA Standard on ice. 
- [ ] Prepare (or obtain) **1X TE buffer** by diluting the 20X TE Buffer 20-fold with nuclease-free water. For example, add 1ml of 20X TE Buffer to 19ml of Nuclease-Free Water, and mix.
- [ ] Dilute the **QuantiFluor® RNA Dye** 1:1000 using 1X TE buffer. This is your working dye solution. For example, add 1.5μl of QuantiFluor® RNA Dye to 1,498.5μl of 1X TE buffer then mix. Note: 1.5mL is a sufficient volume to process 14 samples or standards.
- [x] Dilute the **RNA Standard** 1:1000 using 1X TE buffer. This is your working standard solution. For example, add 1.5μl of RNA Standard to 1,498.5μl of 1X TE buffer then mix. **Note:** This only has to be done once and was already done on June 11, 2016.

## Prepare the samples
- [ ] Obtain and label a 0.5ml quantification tube for each sample and standard
- [ ] Add 95μl 1X TE Buffer to each tube
- [ ] Add 100μl working dye solution to each tube
- [ ] Add 5μl of standard to the appropriate tube. Pipette up and down to mix
- [ ] Incubate assays for 5 minutes at room temperature, protected from light
- [ ] Place in the Quantus<sup>TM</sup> Fluorometer  and measure the fluorescence.
- [ ] You can open the corresponding Maxwell® RSC Instrument results workshop to have the data automatically populate and Excell spreadsheet with the sample layout.

## Cartridge and Sample Prep
- [x] Identify samples to be processed.
- [x] Clean work station & obtain and ice bucket
- [x] Remove DNAase from -20°C and thaw on ice
- [ ] Remove samples from -80°C and thaw on ice.
- [ ] Change gloves before handling cartridges, Maxwell® CSC/ RSC Plungers and Elution Tubes to maintain an RNase-free environment during processing. 
- [ ] Place the cartridges in the deck tray with the printed side facing away from the Elution Tubes. Press down to snap it into position. Note: Center cartridges on the deck.
- [ ] Carefully peel back the seal so that all plastic comes off the top of the cartridge. 
- [ ] Place a Maxwell® CSC/RSC Plunger in the well closest to the Elution Tube (well #8).
- [ ] Place 0.5mL Elution Tubes in the front of the deck tray. Add 40μl of Nuclease-Free Water to the bottom of each Elution Tube.
- [ ] Add 5μl of blue DNase I Solution to well #4 (yellow reagent). 
- [ ] Add 200μl of Lysis Buffer to the thawed punch sample. Vortex vigorously for 15 seconds to mix. Transfer all 400μl of lysate to well #1.

## Running the Maxwell
- [ ] Turn on the Maxwell® RSC Instrument and Tablet PC.
- [ ] Touch the "Maxwell RSC button" to open the software.
- [ ] Touch the "Start" button to access the protocols.
- [ ] Select "Maxwell RSC SimplyRNA Tissue" and touch "Proceed".
- [ ] Enter the lot number and expiration date as prompted.
- [ ] If running < 16 samples, tap the blue bar to de-select a cartridge.
- [ ] Touch "Proceed" then "okay" and the door will open.
- [ ] Confirm that all checklist items have been performed. 
- [ ] Transfer the deck tray with prepared cartridges onto the platform. It should "click" into place.
- [ ] Verify that samples were added to well #1, Elution Tubes have 40μl of Nuclease-Free Water and the caps are open, the Plungers are in well #8., and  #4 is green.
- [ ] Touch the Start button to begin the extraction run. The platform will retract, and the door will close.

## After the Maxwell Run Completes
- [ ] Follow on-screen instructions at the end of the method to open door. Verify that the plungers are located in well #8 of the cartridge at the end of the run. 
- [ ] Remove the deck tray from the instrument. Remove Elution Tubes containing RNA, and close the tubes. 
- [ ] Transfer 5μl RNA to a tube for analysis on the Bioanalyzer. 
- [ ] Transfer 5μl RNA to a tube for analysis on the Quantas. 
- [ ] Transfer remaining ~20μl RNA to a 1.5ml tube for labeled with the RNAseq ID for shipment to the GSAF. 
- [ ] Remove the cartridges and plungers from the deck tray and discard, following your
institutions recommended guidelines for disposal of hazardous material. Do not reuse reagent cartridges, plungers or Elution Tubes.

## Other Useful Information

### Where did these samples come from?
Tissue punches for this project were collected as described [here](../data/sample_info/punches_060915.csv). They were homogenized in 200μL 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization Solution and stored at -80°C.

### Solution Prep and Storage

#### 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization Solution
A volume of 200μl of 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization Solution is needed for each sample. To prepare a working solution, add 20μl of 1-Thioglycerol per milliliter of Homogenization Solution. 1-Thioglycerol is viscous, so careful pipetting is required for accurate measurement. Alternatively, add 600μl of 1-Thioglycerol to the 30ml bottle of Homogenization Solution. Before use, chill the 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization Solution on ice or at 2–10°C. 

**Storage Note:** Store the 1-Thioglycerol/Homogenization Solution at 2–10°C, where it is stable for up to 30 days. Upon receipt, remove 1-Thioglycerol and store at 2–10°C. Store the remaining kit components at room temperature (15–30°C). 1-Thioglycerol also can be stored at room temperature (15–30°C), where it is stable for up to 9 months.

#### DNase I Solution
Add 275μl of Nuclease-Free Water to the vial of lyophilized DNase I. Invert to rinse DNase off the underside of the cap and swirl gently to mix; do not vortex. Add 5μl of Blue Dye to the reconstituted DNase I as a visual aid for pipetting. Dispense the DNase I Solution into single-use aliquots in nuclease-free tubes. Store reconstituted DNase I at –30°C to –10°C. DNase I solution maintains activity for up to 10 freeze-thaw cycles.

# Make a working solution of cDNA

- [ ] Obtain your recently synthesized 20 uL cDNA sample from the -20C.
- [ ] Place your sample on ice.
- [ ] Calculate the volume of water to add for desired working concentration/volume of cDNA. 
- [ ] Add ___ uL water.
- [ ] Keep solution on ice when working and store at -20C when not in use. 


# Create a 5-point serial dilution
Goal: Create a 5-point four-fold dilution series of cDNA from your species. These dilutions will be your templates for qPCR.
- [ ] Obtain and **label** a PCR strip. 
- [ ] Determine the amount of water _____ and cDNA solution _____ to add based on a 4-fold dilution. (Based on how much volume is needed for qPCR reaction).
- [ ] Pipette the calculated amount of water in each tube.
- [ ] Starting with working solution of cDNA, perform stepwise serial dilution, ensuring to pipette mix between each tube.
- [ ] Keep solution on ice when working and store at -20C when not in use.

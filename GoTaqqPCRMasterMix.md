# GoTaq qPCR Master Mix

- [ ]	Thaw the GoTaqÂ® qPCR Master Mix on ice. Vortex and spin. Place on ice.
- [ ]	Thaw the working solution of primers on your bench. Vortex and spin. Place on ice. (Remember to check the concentration of the primer.)
- [ ] Calculate the volumes needed for each reagent. Total volume = Volume per reaction * number of reactions (including samples, standards, and controls) * 20% for error. The total volume for each reaction is 10 uL.

| Reagent | Vol. per reaction | Total Volume |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H20 | | |
| Forward Primer | | |
| Reverse Primer | | |
| GoTaq qPCR Master Mix | | |
| **Total Volume** | | |

- [ ] Add the above reagents in the order specified. Vortex briefly and spin.
- [ ] Obtain a qPCR plate (e.g. MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate).
- [ ] Pipette the volume for 1 reaction into 1 well of the qPCR plate. 
- [ ] Add the appropriate volumn of template (e.g working solution of cDNA) to the appropriate well.
- [ ] Seal the plate with the MicroAmp Optical Adhesive film.
- [ ] Go to the 3rd Floor of Loeb.
- [ ] Spin the plate in a centrifuge built for plates.
- [ ] Load the plate into the QuantStudio5 and run.
